. Inheritance
Concept: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class. It promotes code reusability.

Example:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.sound();  // Inherited method
    dog.bark();   // Dog's own method
    return 0;
}
Interview Questions:

What is the difference between public, protected, and private inheritance?
Can you explain method overriding and provide an example?
