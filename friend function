5. Friend Functions
Concept: A friend function is a function that is not a member of a class but has access to its private and protected members.

Example:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    int length, width, height;

public:
    Box(int l, int w, int h) : length(l), width(w), height(h) {}

    // Friend function
    friend int calculateVolume(Box b);
};

int calculateVolume(Box b) {
    return b.length * b.width * b.height;  // Accessing private members
}

int main() {
    Box box(3, 4, 5);
    cout << "Volume of box: " << calculateVolume(box) << endl;  // Accessing through friend function
    return 0;
}
